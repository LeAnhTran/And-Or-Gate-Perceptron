# Basic-Perceptron
This repo includes C++ and Python Sources of some algorithms for Perceptron and Classification. "Back-Propagation" includes the jupyter notebook implementation of back-prog algorithm. "Perceptron-C" consists of the implementaions of some basic perceptron-based classification algorithm.

Run the C++ programs (in terminal):

step 1: g++ -o output_file filename.cpp

step 2: output_file
